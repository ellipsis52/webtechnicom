Batching
CDRs are delivered in batches, HTTP POST request can contain multiple CDRs. Maximum batch size is 1000. Destination API should be able to process multiple CDRs in same request.

Error handling
If the destination API responds with 2xx HTTP code, the streaming interface will consider all CDRs sent in that request as processed and they will be automatically deleted from the queue. In case of HTTP error (non 2xx response or timeout), CDRs will be stored in the queue and will re-attempt to deliver them after 3 seconds.

Warning
Queue length is limited to 10000 records per customer, extensive downtime or increased delay to process the requests can cause data loss on the customer’s endpoint. Therefore, CDR Streaming mechanism can not be used as the only way to receive CDRs. See the API documentation for other CDR fetching mechanisms.
